# Extensions, Pros & Cons of Naïve Bayes

---

## 1. Extensions of Naïve Bayes

Naïve Bayes has multiple variants depending on how feature likelihoods are modeled:

- **Multinomial Naïve Bayes**
  - Works well for text classification (spam filtering, sentiment analysis).
  - Uses **word counts** or **TF-IDF features**.
  - Example: frequency of words in emails.

- **Bernoulli Naïve Bayes**
  - Assumes **binary features** (word present or absent).
  - Good when features are yes/no type.
  - Example: “Does the email contain the word ‘offer’?”

- **Gaussian Naïve Bayes**
  - For **continuous data** (assumes normal distribution).
  - Example: predicting medical conditions based on continuous features like blood pressure, height, weight.

- **Complement Naïve Bayes**
  - Modified version of Multinomial NB, especially for **imbalanced datasets**.
  - Often performs better on text classification.

## 2. Advantages (Pros)

- **Simple and Fast**
  - Easy to implement and train.
  - Very efficient with large datasets.

- **Performs Well with Text**
  - Surprisingly good at spam filtering, document classification, sentiment analysis.

- **Works with Small Data**
  - Requires less training data compared to other classifiers.

- **Scales Well**
  - Handles high-dimensional data (like thousands of words in text).

- **Interpretability**
  - Probabilistic foundation → outputs class probabilities.

## 3. Limitations (Cons)

- **Strong Independence Assumption**
  - Assumes features are independent (rarely true in real data).
  - Example: In text, words are often dependent ("New York" vs. "New").

- **Zero Probability Problem**
  - If a word never appears in training for a class, its probability becomes zero.
  - **Solution:** Apply *Laplace smoothing*.

- **Continuous Features**
  - Gaussian NB may be inaccurate if data is not normally distributed.

- **Limited Expressiveness**
  - Often outperformed by modern models (SVMs, Random Forests, Deep Learning).

## 4. Reflective Tip 
- *Why do you think Naïve Bayes performs so well on text, even though its “independence” assumption is false?*  
(Hint: dependencies often cancel out, and relative word importance is more crucial than perfect modeling.)

- **Pros:** Simple, fast, good with text, small data friendly.  
- **Cons:** Unrealistic independence assumption, zero probabilities, limited power for complex tasks.
